# H+Active Database #

This script is used to build a SQL Server database called H+Active. The database is used for my Database Foundations series of courses on [LinkedIn Learning](linkedin-learning.pxf.io/databasefoundations).

### To Use: ###
1. Copy the [full text of the script]([https://github.com/awilbert/LIL_DatabaseFoundations/blob/master/H%2BActive-DatabaseFoundations.sql) into a new query window in Management Studio or Azure Data Studio
2. Edit the file paths on lines 8 and 10 to point to your \MSSQL\DATA\ folder
3. Execute the query to build the H+Active database
